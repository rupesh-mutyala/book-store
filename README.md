## Features

### Extensible State Management
We've harnessed the power of Redux to manage the state of Books, Authors and the cart items. Redux ensures a robust and organized state management system, making the application highly maintainable and extensible.

### Responsive Design
This project is designed to adapt to various devices and screen sizes. I've used media queries to provide a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### Modular Architecture
To enhance code maintainability and readability, I've adopted a modular approach. The project leverages Redux to extract state management logic from React components, promoting clean and organized code.
